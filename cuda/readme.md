# ML in CUDA

This will be an outlet for me to test my knowledge of the underlying concepts of machine learning and deep learning models, since I will be implementing them in bare bones cuda. If you have never used CUDA before, I recommend checking out my [cuda repo]("https://github.com/GivyBoy/cuda") that will (in real time) track my cuda knowledge.
